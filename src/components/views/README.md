# View / Page Component

Page views. Entry point form the router.

(eg, http://aesop.com/au/login) "Home, Category, PDP, About"

It receives all props from it's corresponding container, and only renders UI Components and Layout Components.

Use `View` suffix (or page, but `View` is more environment agnostic)
